        <h2>Top 5 support engineer activities</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Dig through server logs to troubleshoot a customer's website behavior</li>
            <span>This can be one of the most rewarding processes of coding. I will acknowledge it can feel like it is not the most glamorous. Tracking down a bug can at times be time consuming, but can be one of the most satisfying feelings when it gets figured out, and everything resumes running smoothly</span>
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case</li>
            <span>One thing that I am quite good at is talking to people and I believe that learning visually, through a video is a great way to learn. The more effort that customers feel like a company is putting forth to educate them on how the system that they are paying for works, the more willing they will be to remain customers for the long term.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product</li>
            <span>When I think about the best software experiences that I have had are the ones where the experience improves as the product matures in age in response to user community input. A great example is the Mass Effect video game series. When the third (and last) installment of the series came out, the whole community of users said that the ending was horrible. They looked at it, said "this is on us, our bad", and released a much better complete game after input from their users.</span>
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before</li>
            <span>Diving into a new language is definitely one of the best things that you can do to improve as a developer. It is unequivocally important to constantly expose one's self to new challenges offered by new systems and language because it is the only way to stay current as technology progresses</span>
            <br>
            <br>
          <li>Help train and onboard new support teammates</li>
            <span>I find it very satisfying when you are showing a new team member a system and you can start to see the gears moving and everything beginning to click in their head. The experience is similar to what I imagine it is like watching CERN spin up. And the forging of new connections with people is super important because of how much time co-workers spend with one another. The reality is, I see my coworkers more often than I see my roommate, so it makes things work so much smoother when everyone gets along</span>

        </ul>
        <h2>Favorite thing about IT support</h2>
          <span>My favorite part of IT support is the personal connection that comes with the work. Providing support for IT customers expands the group of people that I get to interact with, which keeps the interactions that I get to have every day varied. It is an opprotunity to help solve the problems of a new group of people potentially using some interesting new technology.</span>
